# Advanced Object Orientated Programming Project
This is my 4th year project for the advanced object orientated programming module in college. For this project I was required to develop a Java web application that enables two or more text documents to be compared for similarity.

## Minimum Requirements
1. A document or URL should be specified or selected from a web browser and then dispatched to a servlet instance running under Apache Tomcat.
2. Each submitted document should be parsed into its set of constituent shingles and then compared against the existing document(s) in an object-oriented database (db4O) and then stored in the database.
3. The similarity of the submitted document to the set of documents stored in the database should be returned and presented to the session user.
